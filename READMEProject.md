1 Project Introduction 
======
### ***Problem Statement***


1. The project is to create a notebook investigating the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher. 
2. In the notebook, you should discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common  variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python. 
3. Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary statistics to describe each variable 
4. Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for each variable.
5. The notebook should follow a cohesive narrative about the data set.


2 Software needed to run the project 
======
I will run through the different tools and packages that I am using for this project and anslyses.


3 Background on the Iris Dataset 
======

Brief description on the background of the Iris Dataset. Who created it and the different variables involved.

4 Classification of Variables
======
In this section of my notebook I will discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python. 

The 4 variables in question are 

### ***Species***

### ***petallength***

### ***petalwidth***

### ***sepallength***

### ***sepalwidth***
