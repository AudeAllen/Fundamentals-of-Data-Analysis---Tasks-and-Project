# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Tasks and Project <br /> 
<br /> 
The Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Tasks and Project contains all the assignments in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course for this module <br /> 
Here I will explain how I came to the solution of given tasks, reference the sources I researched for solving the problems and list the technologies I used for creating and testing the code <br />
<br />

Software needed to run the Tasks
======

Please see below for the  different tools and packages that I am using for the tasks and anslyses.

- Download Anaconda - Anaconda is a package that aims to simplify package management 
- Download Visual Studio Code
- Jupyer Notebook
- Download Github - https://github.com/AudeAllen/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis---Tasks-and-Project.git
- To run the tasks simply click on 'Run all' for tasks.ipynb. The project is a mix of code and markdown blocks which explain each part of each task. You can perform this action either in Visual Studio code or in Anconda in Jupyer Notebook.

Weekly tasks
======
### ***task1***

  
1. The Collatz conjecture1 is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive
integer x and repeatedly apply the function f (x) below, you always
get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, . . .<br /> 
x รท 2 if x is even<br /> 
3x + 1 otherwise<br /> 
For example, starting with the value 10, which is an even number,
we divide it by 2 to get 5. Then 5 is an odd number so, we multiply
by 3 and add 1 to get 16. Then we repeatedly divide by 2 to
get 8, 4, 2, 1. Once we are at 1, we go back to 4 and get stuck in the
repeating sequence 4, 2, 1 as we suspected.
Your task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for
the first 10,000 positive integers. <br /> 
<br />
<br />

======
### ***task2***


2. Give an overview of the famous penguins data set, explaining 
the types of variables it contains. Suggest the types of variables
that should be used to model them in Python, explaining your
rationale.

======
### ***task3***


3. For each of the variables in the penguins data set,3 suggest what probability distribution from the numpy random distributions list is the most appropriate to model the variable.

======
### ***task4***


4. Suppose you are flipping two coins, each with a probability p of giving heads. Plot the entropy of the total number of heads versus p.

======
### ***task5***


5. Create an appropriate individual plot for each of the variables in
the penguin data set
========================================================================================================================



1 Project Introduction 
======
### ***Problem Statement***


1. The project is to create a notebook investigating the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher. 
2. In the notebook, you should discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common  variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python. 
3. Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary statistics to describe each variable 
4. Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for each variable.
5. The notebook should follow a cohesive narrative about the data set.


2 Software needed to run the project 
======
I will run through the different tools and packages that I am using for this project and anslyses.

- Download Anaconda
- Download Visual Studio Code
- Download Github - https://github.com/AudeAllen/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis---Tasks-and-Project.git
- Jupyer Notebook
- To run this project simply click on 'Run all' for project.ipynb. The project is a mix of code and markdown blocks which explain each part of the project. You can perform this action either in Visual Studio code or in Anconda in Jupyer Notebook.


3 Background on the Iris Dataset 
======

Brief description on the background of the Iris Dataset. Who created it and the different variables involved.

4 Classification of Variables
======
In this section of my notebook I will discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics, and Python. 

The 4 variables in question are 

### ***Species***

- Categorical variable - 3 type of species - Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor

### ***petallength***

- Numerical continuous Variable

### ***petalwidth***

- Numerical continuous Variable

### ***sepallength***

- Numerical continuous Variable

### ***sepalwidth***

- Numerical continuous Variable

5 Summary Statistics
======

The aim of this section of my project is to select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate summary statistics to describe each variable on the iris dataset.


6 Plots
======

In this section I am going to Select, demonstrate, and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for
each variable.
