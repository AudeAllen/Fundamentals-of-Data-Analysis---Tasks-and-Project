# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Tasks and Project <br /> 
<br /> 
The Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Tasks and Project contains all the assignments in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course for this module <br /> 
Here I will explain how I came to the solution of given tasks, reference the sources I researched for solving the problems and list the technologies I used for creating and testing the code <br />
<br />

Weekly tasks
======
### ***task1***

  
1. The Collatz conjecture1 is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive
integer x and repeatedly apply the function f (x) below, you always
get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, . . .<br /> 
x รท 2 if x is even<br /> 
3x + 1 otherwise<br /> 
For example, starting with the value 10, which is an even number,
we divide it by 2 to get 5. Then 5 is an odd number so, we multiply
by 3 and add 1 to get 16. Then we repeatedly divide by 2 to
get 8, 4, 2, 1. Once we are at 1, we go back to 4 and get stuck in the
repeating sequence 4, 2, 1 as we suspected.
Your task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for
the first 10,000 positive integers. <br />

### ***task2***


2. Give an overview of the famous penguins data set, explaining 
the types of variables it contains. Suggest the types of variables
that should be used to model them in Python, explaining your
rationale.

======
### ***task3***


3. For each of the variables in the penguins data set,3 suggest what probability distribution from the numpy random distributions list is the most appropriate to model the variable.
