# Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Tasks and Project <br /> 
<br /> 
The Fundamentals of Data Analysis - Tasks and Project contains all the assignments in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course for this module <br /> 
Here I will explain how I came to the solution of given tasks, reference the sources I researched for solving the problems and list the technologies I used for creating and testing the code <br />

Weekly tasks

### ***task1***

  
1. The Collatz conjecture1 is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. The problem is to prove that if you start with any positive
integer x and repeatedly apply the function f (x) below, you always
get stuck in the repeating sequence 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, . . .<br /> 
x รท 2 if x is even<br /> 
3x + 1 otherwise<br /> 
For example, starting with the value 10, which is an even number,
we divide it by 2 to get 5. Then 5 is an odd number so, we multiply
by 3 and add 1 to get 16. Then we repeatedly divide by 2 to
get 8, 4, 2, 1. Once we are at 1, we go back to 4 and get stuck in the
repeating sequence 4, 2, 1 as we suspected.
Your task is to verify, using Python, that the conjecture is true for
the first 10,000 positive integers. <br />
